NAME
    Test::Expect - Automated driving and testing of terminal-based programs

SYNOPSIS
      # in a t/*.t file:
      use Test::Expect;
      use Test::More tests => 13;
      expect_run(
        command => "perl testme.pl",
        prompt  => 'testme: ',
        quit    => 'quit',
      );
      expect("ping", "pong", "expect");
      expect_send("ping", "expect_send");
      expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");
      expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

DESCRIPTION
    Test::Expect is a module for automated driving and testing of
    terminal-based programs. It is handy for testing interactive programs
    which have a prompt, and is based on the same concepts as the Tcl Expect
    tool. As in Expect::Simple, the Expect object is made available for
    tweaking.

    Test::Expect is intended for use in a test script.

SUBROUTINES
  expect_run
    The expect_run subroutine sets up Test::Expect. You must pass in the
    interactive program to run, what the prompt of the program is, and which
    command quits the program:

      expect_run(
        command => "perl testme.pl",
        prompt  => 'testme: ',
        quit    => 'quit',
      );

  expect
    The expect subroutine is the catch all subroutine. You pass in the
    command, the expected output of the subroutine and an optional comment.

      expect("ping", "pong", "expect");

  expect_send
    The expect_send subroutine sends a command to the program. You pass in
    the command and an optional comment.

      expect_send("ping", "expect_send");

  expect_is
    The expect_is subroutine tests the output of the program like
    Test::More's is. It has an optional comment:

      expect_is("* Hi there, to testme", "expect_is");

  expect_like
    The expect_like subroutine tests the output of the program like
    Test::More's like. It has an optional comment:

      expect_like(qr/Hi there, to testme/, "expect_like");

  expect_handle
    This returns the Expect object.
